Base reality exists as nothing. Inconceivable as it is, the fact remains that all of existence has no logical reason to be at all. What creates this exception to the laws of the nothing that should be is a fluke. A being known as the Speaker persisted despite the nothing, and with it all of creation was born. The Speaker communes with the universe. Whether this communion forced an observer into this world or the act of communion itself requires the prerequisite of observation is not known. All that is known is that near instantaneously after the Speaker persisted from nothing, the Watcher persisted in its mission to observe what must take place. All of existence persists as an exception to the nothing purely because of the act of communing and the observation of it. They fulfill their purpose for millennia but cannot truly perceive this passage of time. Man begins within the earth and beneath the scorched land, a great plain where far above lies the being whose actions cause the universe to persist, the Speaker. The sheer power emitted by this process has burned the area beneath it, causing it to transform into a vast barren landscape devoid of life. And like a virus who inserts itself into a contained system with only the goal of survival and reproduction, man spread across the earth. Some people settle south and a smaller group who learn the fate of the universe take a sick comfort in it. A Church learns this as well and splits with each faction trying to find their own way out of it. The church of the sky and beyond reach a fragment of a meteorite a top the tallest mountain and form their religion around it hoping to access something beyond reality in an escape from the eventual collapse of the unstable and weak system that allows existence to be. The church of the deep strength tunnel towards an ancient being buried in the earth feeding off the energy of the core after hearing it in their heads. Those that settled east feared the knowledge within the cave of their birth and chose to forget the horrible truth in exchange for a fevered tradition to preserve the activities of the Speaker/Watcher. Due to man’s attempt at prolonging the inevitable, the universe lashes out and transforms the wildlife into horrible creatures. Plagued by these creatures, the town plunges into turmoil and one man removes himself to study them, the Scholar. Eventually, the town is destroyed and the Scholar hangs himself in the woods after learning of why these creatures exist and what holds the universe together. The last of these creatures that remains being the Beast, a whole wolfpack blurred together into one large amalgam just barely creating the shape of a wolfman in its blend of multiple furs, skin, and limbs, must be killed and offered to the universe as it was the universe’s greatest warrior. Those that fled the ghost town moved north and founded Jacktown. Here, man lived peacefully ignorant of the instability of the universe growing more technologically advanced. As this civilization expands out, they rediscover the scorched lands. A secret organization was setup to keep tabs on both the Speaker and the Watcher choosing to instead play an indirect approach and improve their chances by being the surrogate Watchers. In their attempts to create beings like the Speaker and Watcher, the Organization begins experimenting with perception and what it means to exist and observe. The universe again lashes out and turns their experiments into mole people, blind and dumb. An agent at the Organization who learns of the philosophy of the Fishing Village becomes radicalized by these ideas and the dreams he begins to have. With the knowledge of the Watcher, and the surrounding area, this Madman tunnels up the nearby mountain and builds a structure up to the Watcher’s shack and kills her, ending the all of existence. The player roams a limbo like remnant of the world populated only by the poor souls involved with the ending of everything. The great civilizations, the Ghost Town, Jacktown, the Organization, the Churches, and the Fishing village weakly exist in this state. Leftover fragments of the people and creatures phase in and out of reality. The Watcher, The Beast, The Madman, and finally you. 

You Are the Speaker.
